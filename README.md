This work provides a complicated image processing and analysis approach for the categorization of particles in microscope photographs. The recommended procedure combines editing, multi-stage processing, and photo file alteration to increase particle exposure. Particle segmentation and outline filtering procedures are employed to obtain significant features, and then a detailed analysis of particle sizes, locations, and aspect ratios is done.
